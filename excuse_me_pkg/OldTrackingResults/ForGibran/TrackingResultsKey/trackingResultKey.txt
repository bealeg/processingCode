output for tracking node:

ego vehicle file:

	15 columns pertain to ego vehicle information	

	-(1) timestamp
	-(2) frame_id (should be 'map1')
	-(3) x position relative to stationary map frame
	-(4) y position relative to stationary map frame
	-(5) z position relative to stationary map frame
	-(6) lattitude coordinates
	-(7) longitude coordinates
	-(8) height above geoid (m)
	-(9) yaw angle (should be in radians)
	-(10) linear x velocity (used as overall speed m/s)
	-(11) linear y velocity (should always be 0)
	-(12) linear z velocity (should be 0)
	-(13) angular x velocity
	-(14) angular y velocity
	-(15) angular z velocity

tracked object file:
	
	16 + blank column + 10 + blank column + 4 = 32 columns that pertain to tracked object information

	- relative to base_link_ground frame (ego vehicle)
	-(1) timestamp
 	-(2) id
	-(3) frame_id (should be base_link_ground)
	-(4) bounding box dimension x

	-(6) bounding box dimension z
	-(7) centroid position x
	-(8) centroid position y
	-(9) centroid position z
	-(10) yaw (should be radians)
	-(11) linear x velocity (should be overall speed, m/s, not reliable as of right now)
	-(12) linear y velocity (should always be 0)
	-(13) linear z velocity
	-(14) angular x velo (should always be 0)
	-(15) angular y velo (should always be 0)
	-(16) angular z velo (should always be 0)
	-(17) blank

	- relative to the map1 frame
	-(18) timestamp (again, for redundancy)
	-(19) frame_id (should be map)
	-(20) object_id (should be same as in column 2)
	-(21) bounding box dimensions x (should be same as 4)
	-(22) bounding box dimensions y (should be same as 5)
	-(23) bounding box dimensions z (should be same as 6)
	-(24) centroid position x
	-(25) centroid position y
	-(26) centroid position z
	-(27) yaw (in radians)
	-(28) blank
	
	- lattitude and longitude coordinates
	-(29) object id (should be same as 20 and 2)
	-(30) lattitude coordinate
