output for tracking node:

ego vehicle file:

	15 columns pertain to ego vehicle information	

	- timestamp:
	- frame_id: (should be 'map_veh')
	- x_pos: position relative to stationary map_veh frame
	- y_pos: position relative to stationary map_veh frame
	- z_pos: position relative to stationary map_veh frame
	- lat: lattitude coordinates
	- lon: longitude coordinates
	- alt: height above geoid (m)
	- yaw: yaw angle (should be in radians)
	- vx: linear x velocity (however, in this case used as overall speed in m/s)
	- vy: linear y velocity (should always be 0, not populated)
	- vz: linear z velocity (should always be 0, not populated)
	- x_ang: angular x velocity
	- y_ang: angular y velocity
	- z_ang: angular z velocity
